    You have 60 Seconds to collect as many cookies as possible. Use your bakers (Ian, Vicky, and Alex) to help you produce more cookies. Once you collect enough, you can also upgrade each baker. The Super Clicker makes each click worth 2x its value! Scores are based on the total cookie count. Do you have what it takes to be on the HighScore Board? PLAY NOW!
