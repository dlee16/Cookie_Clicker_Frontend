## About
Welcome to Cookie Clicker!

We have 3 game options: 

1. 1 Min Game
* You have 60 Seconds to collect as many cookies as possible. Use your bakers (Ian, Vicky, and Alex) to help you produce more cookies. Once you collect enough, you can also upgrade each baker. The Super Clicker makes each click worth 2x its value! Scores are based on the total cookie count. Do you have what it takes to be on the HighScore Board? PLAY NOW!

2. Classic Game
* Collect as many cookies as you want. Use your bakers (Ian, Vicky, and Alex) to help you produce more cookies. Once you collect enough, you can also upgrade each baker. The Super Clicker makes each click worth 2x its value! PLAY NOW!
P.S. You can use this mode as practice for the 1 min challenge!

3. Custom Game
* Same as the classic game, but you can add your own baker! Oh man... PLAY NOW!
